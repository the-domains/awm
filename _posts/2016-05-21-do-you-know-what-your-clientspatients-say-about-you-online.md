Do you know what your clients/patients say about you online? Are you responding to them when they post a review?

Almost everyone searches and reads online reviews about a local service or business before they decide to do business with them. Reviews need to be fresh (not older than 6 months) and you need at least 6-10 online reviews to be trusted. How do we know this? From last December's consumer survey data.

What does this mean for you and your business? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b92481ff-bbd5-4e29-983c-5f779c2d6eb3.jpg)

1\. Being "in the know" is very important. At the same time, it is impossible to follow and check all the review sites on your own - it would take too much time. If you haven't set up a monitoring and alert system yet, we can help.

2\. Being visible is crucial. If you own a local business with a physical location (or multiple locations), you need to have accurate and consistent listings in at least 20-30 online directories, including Google Maps, Facebook and other not-so-well-known ones. These listings serve as little "votes" (=back-links) for your main website and will improve your local ranking in Google searches after a few weeks or months.

3\. You need multiple ways to gather reviews. It has to be super easy and hassle-free for clients/patients to leave a review for you. Some people are more tech-savvy than others; why not accommodate all skill levels?
